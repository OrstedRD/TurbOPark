# TurbOPark
A Turbulence Optimized Park model.

The TurbOPark wake model has been developed by Ã˜rsted and was validated on 19 offshore wind farms coupled with a blockage and a flow model.

## Documentation
A note describing the wake model can be found here: [TurbOPark description](https://github.com/OrstedRD/TurbOPark/blob/main/TurbOPark%20description.pdf)

## Examples
In the MATLAB live editor file [TurbOParkExamples.mlx](https://github.com/OrstedRD/TurbOPark/blob/main/TurbOParkExamples.mlx) you can find two examples to get you started.

If you do not have a MATLAB licence, you may not be able to open the .mlx file. You can instead take a look at the [TurbOParkExamples.pdf](https://github.com/OrstedRD/TurbOPark/blob/main/TurbOParkExamples.pdf) file. 

## Software
The code is developed for MATLAB R2019b.

## Scientific papers
- [Modelling cluster wakes and wind farm blockage](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1618/6/062072): This paper uses a beta-version of TurbOPark with a top-hat wake profile and a expansion parameter based on fewer data. The paper describes how to couple the wake model with a blockage model.
